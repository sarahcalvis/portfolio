        <p>
          I am a software developer at Quadax in Middleburg Heights, Ohio with a bachelor's degree in computer science at Grove City College.

          Programming is fun to me because code is a craft as much as it is a logic exercise.
          Software development is a way to serve others by making all sorts of tasks more efficient.
          I am thrilled to think about all the ways that effective software can further human flourishing!

          When I am not coding, I enjoy reading old books,
          spending time with my four little sisters,
          and long walks in the beautiful Midwest.
